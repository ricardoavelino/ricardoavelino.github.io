I am a structural engineer and code developer with strong interest in historic structures and optimisation. 

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/), working under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Philippe Block at the [Block Research Group](https://www.block.arch.ethz.ch/) with the aim of developing practical computational tools to improve assessment of historic masonry structures. My research project is funded by the [Swiss National Science Foundation](http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx).

Previously, I graduated in a dual degree program at [Universidade de São Paulo (Poli-USP)](https://www.poli.usp.br) and [École des Ponts Paristech](https://www.ecoledesponts.fr), where I received highest merit (Prix Betancout) and the Eiffel excellence scholarship. I also worked as structural engineer intern in the architectural firm [Skidmore Owings & Merril (SOM)](https://www.som.com/).

I plan to update this with my latest publication and software development. [Get in touch](malito:mricardo@ethz.ch) if you want to collaborate!
