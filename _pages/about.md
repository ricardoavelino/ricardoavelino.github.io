I am a structural designer and researcher with strong interest in AI, sustainable design, historic structures and optimization. 

I am an incoming postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Augmented Computational Design in Architecture, Engineering and Construction ([Design++](https://designplusplus.ethz.ch)) where I will be hosted by the [Block Research Group](https://www.block.arch.ethz.ch/) and the [Interactive Visualization & Intelligence Augmentation Lab](https://ivia.ethz.ch) researching on AI agents for structural design. I am also a structural engineer consultant in the architectural & engineering firm [Skidmore Owings & Merrill (SOM)](https://www.som.com/) where I assist with complex structural engineering projects.

My work focuses on the interface of structural mechanics, computational design and architecture. I aim to bring new technologies, such as AI and AR to improve the productivity in the AEC industry helping to design efficient low-carbon structures and preserve and protect existing buildings.

On my [doctoral dissertation](https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000611351) at ETH Zurich, I developed novel computational analysis methods to assess complex unreinforced masonry structures and design efficient structural systems, having my work nominated to the ETH Medal. I also worked as a postdoctoral researcher for the [Heritage++](https://letters.rilem.net/index.php/rilem/article/view/202) project at ETH and as a structural engineer at SOM designing structures ranging from high-rise buildings to long span structures to shell and cable nets.

I plan to update this with my latest publication and software development. [Get in touch](malito:mricardo@ethz.ch) if you want to collaborate!
