I am a structural engineer and code developer with strong interest in historic structures and optimisation. 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of [Physical Chemistry of Building Materials](https://ifb.ethz.ch/pcbm) and the [Block Research Group](https://www.block.arch.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. I am also research affiliate at the Center for Augmented Computational Design in Architecture, Engineering and Construction ([Design++](https://designplusplus.ethz.ch)). 

My research interest includes combining augmented reality and structural analysis to improve the preservation of masonry heritage buildings and developing AI-​informed algorithms to design efficient low-carbon structures.

In December 2022, I defended my PhD at ETH Zurich advised by Prof. Dr. Philippe Block where I developed novel computational analysis methods to assess complex unreinforced masonry structures and design efficient structural systems. My dissertation was nominated for the ETH Medal for outstanding dissertation and funded by the [Swiss National Science Foundation](http://www.snf.ch/en/Pages/default.aspx).

Previously, I graduated in a dual degree program at [Universidade de São Paulo (Poli-USP)](https://www.poli.usp.br) and [École des Ponts Paristech](https://www.ecoledesponts.fr), where I received highest merit (Prix Betancout) and the Eiffel excellence scholarship. I also worked as structural engineer intern in the architectural firm [Skidmore Owings & Merril (SOM)](https://www.som.com/).

I plan to update this with my latest publication and software development. [Get in touch](malito:mricardo@ethz.ch) if you want to collaborate!
